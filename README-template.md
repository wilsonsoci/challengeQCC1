## My process

I used everything I've learned so far. (With a little help of Stack Overflow)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Useful Code Samples:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  border-radius: 20px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to improve my HTML divisions and CSS Flexbox!

### Useful resources
